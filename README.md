## Getting Started with Git

> _[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows._

2. **Fill Out Repository Details**:
    - Set the repository **name** (e.g., `example`).
    - Add a **description** to describe the purpose of the repository (e.g., "An example repository for demo purposes").

    - Optionally, initialize the repository with:
        - A `README` file.
        - A `.gitignore` template.
        - A license of your choice.
